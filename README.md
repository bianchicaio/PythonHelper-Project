# PythonHelper-Project
  This is my CS50P (Programming with Python) final project:

  The file "pytree3.py" is the first version of the project where everything happens in the terminal, the program prompts the user for wich subject
of Python he wants to work with between Data Science/Web Application/Mobile App/Games/Automation. After that the program display the avaible libraries and 
ask wich library the user wants to learn about and then give back the documentation link of that library.


  The second file "pytree5.py" is the final version of the project, I decided to implement a GUI using the library "Tkinter", so all the subjects are there
when the user runs the program, when you click a subject it shows the avaible libraries and with a double click in the library it opens the documentation in your
browser

  I hope my program can help Python Developers to know new libraries, making easier their work !
